# Obesity-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Methods

## OBJECTIVE: 
This work seeks to predict obesity using data from the 'Estimation of Obesity Levels based 
on Eating Habits and Physical Condition dataset' from the UC,IRVINE Machine Learning 
database. There are a total of 2111 instances of data collected, with 17 attributes. The data is 
classified using the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, 
Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II, and Obesity Type III in the class 
variable NObesity, which is the Obesity Level. The data is made up of 77% synthetic data 
created with the Weka tool and the SMOTE filter, and 24% data obtained directly from 
consumers via a web platform. The data is then utilized to determine and forecast an 
individual's level of obesity using machine learning approaches.
